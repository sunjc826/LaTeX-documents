## Notation
In backtick-quoted code, equality checking, comparisons etc follow the Java style, e.g. `==` for equality, `<=,>=` for comparisons.
In dollar-quoted maths, equality checking, comparisons will follow usual mathematical notation.

Furthermore, a mathematical statement like $x=1$, would in code form be `x==1`. This is to be taken as a declaration that $x$ equals $1$ is a true statement, unless it is explicitly mentioned for e.g., that `x==1` does not hold, or that `x==1` evaluates to false.

## Mutual Exclusion

### Peterson's Algorithm
Pg. 22: There is a relatively trivial detail to be addressed before proving mutual exclusion. The proof starts by assuming WLOG that $P_0$ was the first process to enter the critical section (CS). However, it needs to be shown that at least one process can even enter the CS at the beginning, i.e. the progress criterion. 
To show this, it suffices to prove that amongst the 2 function calls {`requestCS(0)`, `requestCS(1)`} (to be more rigorous, we have to consider any non-empty subset of calls, i.e. it could be that only `requestCS(0)` was made, or only `requestCS(1)` was made, or both), at least one call will return, indicating that at least one process enters the CS. The only line that can possibly block is the line stating 
```java
while (wantCS[j] && turn == j)
```
where $j\in \{0, 1\}$. We then consider cases.
- If both `requestCS(0)`, `requestCS(1)` are called, then it is not possible for both `turn == 0`, `turn == 1` to evaluate to true, which would be the case if both processes are blocked. Hence, at least one process goes through.
- (WLOG) If only `requestCS(0)` is called, then `turn == 1`, but `wantCS[1] == false`, hence the predicate `wantCS[1] && turn == 1` evaluates to false and process 0 goes through.

Hence, we have proven progress (*at the start*).

Pg. 23: A discussion regarding the proof of mutual exclusion.
#### Composite boolean expressions
In the case of Peterson's algorithm, there is only 1 conjunctive boolean expression given by `wantCS[j] && (turn == j)`. Whether or not the evaluation of the expression is atomic is not so relevant here (though it most likely isn't). It is worth noting that $\land$ conditions terminate prematurely if any evaluates to `false`. Hence, the case analysis that forms the backbone of this proof simply considers the earliest point at which the conjuctive expression evaluates to false (for the process that enters the CS).

#### Mutual exclusion proofs
When attempting to prove mutual exclusion, we can only make 2 assumptions. At a certain point in time:
1. There exists 1 process in the CS
2. There is at least one other process that has called `requestCS`.
i.e. we should make no assumptions about where are the exact whereabouts of any process, only that one process has entered the CS by some means, and that there are a non-zero number of processes *currently in* or *potentially entering* the code segment of `requestCS`, and our aim is to show regardless of the current whereabouts of these other processes, they cannot enter the CS.

In the proof on pg. 23 of Peterson's Algorithm, one technique employed by case analysis involves using the knowledge of how process $P_0$ entered the CS to deduce the whereabouts of process $P_1$.
